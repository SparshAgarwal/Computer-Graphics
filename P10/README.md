Definition for town:
There is an overhead water tank in north west which will have the name of town
All the things have specular lighting as well
All the houses have a vehicle in red on their right
There is a pond between the houses and the pond has grey seats around it. 
There is a airship that air patrols the city.
The airship lands only on the helipad, not on any house.
It chooses its path randomly.

P8 increments:
Implemented 2 textures, 
	1. side texture wraps on wall and roof, the texture is on both sides of house, (This image was taken from web)
	2. the front and back of house are wrapped by other texture, the image used in this texture was taken by me. 
Both the textures have lighting effects.

P9 increments:
Tree color improved
I have implemented three advanced textures in this projected:
	Skybox
	Environment reflection mapping
	Specular mapping
Along with these three advanced textures I have also added to the project a new model object i.e. Chicago Bean, on which the environment reflection mapping is implemented. 
Specular mapping is both on the houses and the bean.

P10 increments:
Replaced mock cars with actual cars with specular and diffused lighting
Added a new car model
