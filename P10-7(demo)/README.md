Definition for town:
There is an overhead water tank in north west which will have the name of town
All the things have specular lighting as well
All the houses have a vehicle in red on their right
There is a pond between the houses and the pond has grey seats around it. 
There is a airship that air patrols the city.
The airship lands only on the helipad, not on any house.
It chooses its path randomly.
